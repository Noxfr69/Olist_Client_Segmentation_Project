# Online Client Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the segmentation of online clients using various machine learning techniques and metrics. The project consists of three separate Jupyter notebooks, each addressing a critical aspect: Data Exploration, Clustering Algorithms, and Model Update Frequency Evaluation using ARI metrics.

### Data Exploration

* [Notebook is here](https://github.com/Noxfr69/Energy_Consumption_Prediction/blob/main/data_exploration_P5.ipynb)
In this notebook, we explore the dataset's key characteristics, distributions, and patterns to better understand the client base.


### Clustering Algorithms

* [Notebook is here](https://github.com/Noxfr69/Energy_Consumption_Prediction/blob/main/clustering_notebook_P5.ipynb)
Here, we apply unsupervised learning techniques like:

- K-means clustering
- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction

### Model Update Frequency

* [Notebook is here](https://github.com/Noxfr69/Energy_Consumption_Prediction/blob/main/rand_index_updating_model_frequency.ipynb)
This notebook focuses on evaluating the optimal model update frequency using ARI (Adjusted Rand Index) metrics.
